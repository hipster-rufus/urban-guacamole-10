# urban-guacamole-10

## Description
The Module 10 Challenge focuses on object-orientend programming to create an SVG logo generator

## Installation
To install my project, you will need to clone my repository from GitHub onto a local directory by entering this code into your terminal:

`git clone https://github.com/hipster-rufus/urban-guacamole-10.git`

## Usage
Once the repo has been cloned, run the program through your terminal: `node index.js`.
This will prompt a series of questions which will generate your new SVG logo. Once each question has been answered, an SVG file will write and save into the "examples" folder, named and ready to go!
